### Per tutorial
list of models and textures
list of variables
shader names
need func pointer for shutdown buffers
different func for set shader params
function pointer for attributes in set model


## ToDo
- [ ] Triangle model
- [ ] Maybe actually remove openGL move functions
- [ ] Figure out which functions are just redundant name things that can be removed

- [ ] Generic initialize buffers
- [ ] look over struct and whether they are actually doing anything with meaning or there is value in restructuring everything

## When creating new scene
* Init application difference
* Set shader parameters difference
* Init initialize buffers
