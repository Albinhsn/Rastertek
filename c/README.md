## ToDo
- [ ] Swap bools to enum
- [ ] Triangle model
- [ ] Remove openGL move functions
- [ ] Figure out which functions are just redundant name things that can be removed
- [ ] look over struct and whether they are actually doing anything with meaning or there is value in restructuring everything
- [ ] Generic load texture?
- [ ] RGB and RGBA are just vec3/vec4
