## ToDo
- [ ] Triangle model
- [ ] Remove openGL move functions
- [ ] Figure out which functions are just redundant name things that can be removed
- [ ] look over struct and whether they are actually doing anything with meaning or there is value in restructuring everything

## When creating new scene
* Init application difference
* Set shader parameters difference
